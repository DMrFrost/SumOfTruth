    <h1 id="title">The Philosophy Behind it All</h1>
    <section id="contentBox">
      <div class="reasons">
        <h2>Understand myself, what I believe, and why I believe</h2>
        <p>
        	Belief is the base to action, and action makes us the human that we are.  If
          you observe your actions you will have noticed you don’t always make the best
          choices.  We all falter, it is part of the process of learning.  But through
          these failures we are given a glimpse of clarity, a glimpse of “what doesnt
          work.”  The trick is to then modify your beliefs and carry on in life, acting
          along the new accord(this is basically the scientific method).  By understanding
          your beliefs, and why you choose to believe them you are empowered to change
          them and tweak them at will.  You can change how you choose to see the world,
          and find a model with a broader spectrum of truth.  The model through which you
          choose to see the world, will have major implications in what you are able to
          accomplish, and will grant you degrees of control over the
          actions you take in day to day life.  Understanding the belief model you use
          to make decisions and evolving this base, is paramount.

      <div class="reasons">
        <h2>Acknowledgement of Oneness</h2>
        <p>
        	The connection between us.  The existence of a fabric of consciousness that
          connects all life is not something easily articulated.  It is even more difficult
          to demonstrate.  I choose to believe that the connection I feel to the world
          around me, is as real as anything I can touch.  I believe I am a part of
          something much larger than myself, and so are you.  I believe that when you
          suffer, I suffer, and when I learn, you learn, when we find peace, we find
          peace.  I believe this based on what I have seen, and what I feel.  Completely
          anecdotal, but our lives are anecdotal and subjective experience cannot be
          dismissed completely.  Its not always easy to see this connection, and so I
          sometimes lose sight of my greater self.  It is not always easy to base my
          actions on this principle, our egos are powerful, and often get the better us
          us.  But as I practice living in Oneness, I choose to act for the good of others,
          and I see more and more that others choose to act for the good of me.

            An interesting experiment is to choose an object in your vicinity and
            ask, "how many people did it take to make this?"  Just a simple pencil
            depends on all of us....

          <h2>Why I Walk</h2>
          <p>
            I walk too see the world.  I walk too meet the people here.  I walk
            to hear their stories and to give a hand where I can.  I walk to
            experience the world in a manner that we are all capable of.  I walk
            to inspire others to follow, to follow their own inspiration and
            dreams no matter how impossible it may seem.  I walk to use my body,
            my vehicle, my home and my temple, and to strengthen and maintain
             myself.  I walk to push the boundaries of what I know, and to challenge
             what I believe.  I walk to forge and temper a stronger man, a more
             intelligent man, and a wiser man.

        <div class="reasons">
          <h2>Why I  Don't Use Money</h2>
          <p>
            It seems, in the eyes of others, the most radical part of my philosophy
            is the abandon of money.  Why would you give up on currency?  What is the
            deal with that?  The phrase which floats around is “money is the root of
            all evil”.  We have all heard this, though I don’t believe it. The truth
            is, currency is a great tool, its invention and introduction made the
            marketplace a much easier place to navigate.  There is nothing intrinsically
            wrong with money.  However there is an inherent problem, inherited from us,
            and the manner in which we choose to see and use money.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the dollar is indeed a useful tool, it and our economy dominate
            the decision making processes on a global level.  National policies
            and local business practices are incentivized to increase profits
            often at the expense of environmental and human health.   For many of
            us, money also dictates our own personal decision making processes.
            How many of us live where we want to live, and spend our time doing
            what we want to be doing?  Not many.  Our money is more than a currency,
            our money is the lifeblood of a system which has been built on
            exploitation and domination of others.  The exploitation and domination
            of us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wealth comes in many forms, and the questions is… which wealth is
            the most valuable to you?  Numbers on an ATM screen?  Paper dollars?
            Material assets?  Health?  Relationships? Happiness?  Experiencing
            the process of living?
          </p>
          <p>
            I have met many people who seem to prioritize life, based on acquiring
            wealth in the order I listed above.  But I have to wonder, why are we
            trading the very real experience of living our lives, for the completely
            intangible numbers on a screen?  In my mind the inverse order is much
            more correct.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before this adventure starts it seems to me that living without money
             is an unthinkable, impossible task.   I  choose to live without money
             simply as an experiment, and to push the limits of what we believe
             in as possible.   I also choose to live without money because it feels
             great to be free from the terror of checking your ATM balance.
