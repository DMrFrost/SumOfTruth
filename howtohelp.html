    <h1 id="title">How To Help</h1>
    <section id="contentBox">

        <p>
        Helping comes in many shapes and forms.  Being part of the web of hummanity
        gives you two major options in how to affect the world.  You can turn
        your attention to the world within, your own consious parradigm, where ultimately
        you have the most influence.  Or you can turn your focus outwards, to the
        exterior world, where there are many ways to help others.  Because we are all
        linked, both serve the good of the whole, and the good of the self.
      </p>  <br>

      <h2>Help Yourself</h2>
        <p>
        The most necessary and difficult of tasks.  It is often challenging to listen
        to ourselves and to know what it is what we need.  It is even more challenging to
        apply this knowledge to our daily routine.  Helping yourself is a multi faceted
        job.  It requires taking care of your physical body, taking care of your emotional/mental
        self, taking care of your connection to the whole, your spiritual self, and finally
        taking care of your relationships, others.  Ultimately these all intertwine, and when we are
        lacking in one, it takes tolls on the other facets of being.
      </p>  <br>

      <h2>Help Your Community</h2>
      <p>
        Reach out into your personal sphere of influence.  We have the power to make
        great changes locally if we put our minds to it.  Just passing one smile to one
        person on your commute changes the world.  Talk to people, get involved, find
        out what people need to live better lives and facilitate it through conversation
        and work.
      </p>  <br>

      <h2>Help Our Jounrey</h2>
      <p>
        The main way you can help us personally, is by sharing human connections.
        Are you on our projected path?  Do you have friends and family where we will be
        walking?  Connect us!  You can even use
        <span class="globeTrekSpan" onclick="globeTrek()">the map</span>
        app(globe in top right corner) and drop a marker on the map
        along with whatever information you'd like.  Just click add shelter and
        follow the form.  The more people who participate, the less daunting this
        journey will be.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the main points of the walking journey is frugality.  We don't carry much
        and each item we take, serves an important purpose.  If it arises that a new
        item is needed, we will be asking for help in getting what we need.  A list
        will be posted here...
      </p>

      <p>
        and anyone can contribute to the cause.  We will also be excepting donations.
        While leaving money by the wayside is our mission, our internet server does
        require a monthly payment.  Whatever funds we accumulate will go towards the very
        basics of keeping our philosophy alive, and ideas published to the public domain.
        If for some reason we acquire excess, we will be donating to whatever community
        needs the help.
