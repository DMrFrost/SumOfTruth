      <br><p>Hello World, I am SumOne. </p><br><p>I am just like you. In fact in what Ive seen
        of the world we all share allot in common.  We are all humans, seeking survival,
        happiness, friendship comfort and our place here on this world of ours.
        I am just like you, I am confused, ignorant, scared, and for the most part
        acting out of instinct and habbit rather than acting consciously.  I am
        offended by the suffering which is all around and allowed to continue every
        day.  I am lost in the chaos of the world, and in the impossible task of
        finding and understanding the truth of myself and my surroundings.</p><br>

            </picture>
        </div>


        Yet...<br><br>
        <p>I love my planet and the vibrant life here. The art and culture that
        people create and share with one another is exquisit.  The beauty and the
        kindness I see from so many people, combined with the miracle of the Earth
        and the abundance it provides, leaves me feeling blessed everyday.  Every
        breath I take, every glass of water I drink, every meal and their many
        ingrediants I eat... Ifeel so fortunate in this life that I say
        "Thank You", but thats not enough.</p><br>

        <p>
        I am SumOne, someone who has decided to live life pursuing the good of the
        whole.  I follow my curiosity in the hopes that there may yet be truth to be
        found... hidden in the chaos and information of the world.</p><br>  <br>

        <p>I am SumOne, I aim to walk, talk, ask and learn... help others, build, connect
        and trust in others as they have trusted in me.  I dedicate my life to the
        journey of studying and working, every moment, in the hopes that hummanity
        and the greater picture may find some value in understanding the Self, the World,
        and the Humanity we are all a part of.</p><br>

        <p>We all feel a potential to be something great, and the power to change the
        world.  We all feel the fabric of life which connects us to one another
        and to the world at large. We, humans, are amazing creatures, we are powerful
        creatures, look at what we can do when we work together.  Its time we start
        using that power, our power, responsibly, and purposefully.  Take your personal
        power back, and start creating the world you have always wanted to see.</p><br>
