Identity:  Examining Myself
SumOne
10/2017
Identity defines us as the unique entity we are.  It is the internal framework that allows us to know and define ourself.  It is the external persona, the version of us viewed by others.  It is also an abstract idea that exists apart from our physical and conscious being, and can  evolve and develop on its own accord.  All of these parts associate, dynamically influencing one another and many times become indistinguishable.  Whether we are consciously creating the outer version that other people see and interact with, or whether we act and respond to the world based on the pressures of who we are expected to be.  The direction of this “cause and effect” relationship determines whether we have power over the world and our place in it, or whether we are enslaved by the identity we are branded with.
Who am I?
It is a simple questions which at first glance may seem ridiculous.  Why would I inquire about something so obvious?  After all it is the one thing that each of us know most intimately, ourself.  We have lived with it the entirely of our lives.  There is nothing more intrinsically tied to us than our own self, and the identity that carries.  Since birth we experience all of the world through our Self, but the idea of our identity is built up (at least in the beginning) by others.  Others give us a name, teach us the rules of the house, the truths of the world, and teach us how to behave through praise and punishment.   Who I am, at least in the beginning, is the collaboration of the people closest to me.  We carry their virtues and their immaturities.  After years of practice, there comes a point where we may gain control of our own identity.  It comes as the ability to make conscious choices, but unless exercised regularly, this power may remain mostly dormant.

Who am I?
Well we first we have to understand which “who” we are looking for.
The Self is more than “who” we are, it is “what” we are.  It lies at the base of the mystery of human existence, and is the source of our being.  Some call this the soul, others call it our spiritual side, the observer or true objectiveness.  No matter the name, it exists at our nucleus, and can be gleamed in moments where the identity is left aside.  Most notably I have seen the Self in moments of artistic expression, physical exertion, meditation, solidarity with community, and intaking hallucinogenic substances (Ayahuasca, Peyote, Psilocybin ).  Being in nature adds a sense of wonder, and makes achieving deeper objectiveness possible in all the above activities.
We will save a conversation about the self for another day.
The identity is the “who”.  Consciously, it is the idea of who I tell myself I am.  I have a name, I am a physical body, I am a collection of stories/experiences, I am my beliefs, and the activities/work that I do.  I am my conversation starter, how I choose to dress and the facade of myself I share with the world by choice.  This is the rather obvious one dimensional version of our identity.
Another large part of identity exists in our subconscious.  This part is difficult to see from the inside, but it manifests as we carry out our habits, we navigate a conversation by sticking to superficial talking points we are comfortable with, or as we walk the same route to lunch everyday.  It plays out in routine, in addiction, and in all choices that aren’t deliberately thought about.  Large parts of who we are and how we complete tasks is completely subconscious.  All of this is the beginnings of the internal-identity which we carry.  (An interesting point is that most of the subconscious identity originated as conscious choice, and through repetition slid into the realm of subconscions.)
But identity has an entire other half, our external-identity (edentity).  A large part of who we are is carried in the world, in the minds of others, and this part of who-we-are has just as much impact on us as our internal-identity.  In the mind of each friend, each family member, and each acquaintance; there exists another piece, a fragment of our edentity.  Each relationship carries with it the creation of a new part of our edentity.  This edentity exists scattered where you have been , like seeds left behind in the minds of others.  This part of us has very real implications in the world, as relationships with others may open doors of opportunity, or pose obstacles.  Knowing others is an invaluable tool for progressing in the world, and better knowing yourself.
Your name for example and how you present yourself will be among the first things which are captured in a new relationship.  You will further be known as the actions you are observed doing, the words you say, and the habits you unconsciously demonstrate.  Each person will also undoubtedly add their own bias to who you are, and in many cases these external versions of yourself can pressure you into conforming to this exterior belief.  The internal and external identity are inescapably tied to one another.  They will interact and dynamically influence the whole of who you are.  The take away here is to be aware of this interaction, and to maintain the pilots chair when it comes to who you are, and what you choose to do.

To take things one step deeper into the complex of identity, we have to dive back into the inner.  The internal-identity we carry is not usually as one object.  It is many times self-conflicting, contradiction and dynamically changing.  The edentity is fragmented between the minds of others on the outside, likewise our identity is fragmented within.  To me it appears as multiple identities, my multi-self, “the council of Danes” I call my own.  These different selves have different priorities, different ideas about what I want to do in the day, and even different belief structures.  In extreme cases this manifests as multiple personality disorder, then the selves are so seperated that they can’t coexist at the same point in time.  But most of us have this to a much lesser degree.  You can see your multi-self every time you fight off a craving, part of you wants the cake, and part of you knows better.  Another example is when you believe something but carry doubt.  Also every time you think critically about yourself , “what am I doing?”, “I __ myself”.  In these cases you can actually see the multi-self represented in the mechanics of language.   These self directed statements are one part of yourself asking another part.
Who am I?
Identity is the consequence of being born.  We don’t ask for it, but we are given it.  It helps us navigate and participate in the human collective, and helps us to understand our own inner labyrinth and the choices we must make.
At a certain point, you begin to define yourself.  At first this is achieved haphazardly, we act, we learn, we act again.  But one day you become aware that you are your own person, your own island consciousness, and that you alone stand to reap the benefits and consequences of your actions.  You realize you have free will to act, and that you become defined by these actions.  On this day you gain the power to mold your identity purposefully.  You can create yourself by exercising conscious choice.  “I want to be someone who plays guitar” can be achieved on purpose.  At the same time, continuing to act haphazardly can lead us to being defined by the consequences we inadvertently deserve.
Within our ability to create ourselves, and to create through ourselves, lies the true power of human consciousness.  But it is not so simple.  Instead of seeing our identity as a canvas to paint on, it often becomes a construct to live by
In the minds of others perhaps we are thought of as “this families future”, “a successful student”, or  “a best friend”.  Sounds great, and to many extents it is.  You have earned the respect of others, and they think well of you.  You may even think well of yourself.  However if we don’t maintain a separation between our identity and our true Self, this identity can now control us.  The expectations of others (or ourselves) now bind us to maintaining this belief, and we may sacrifice import aspects of being who we truly want to be, in order to maintain this identity.
“I am a successful student therefor I can’t afford a social life.”
“I am this families future therefore I shouldn’t waste time learning guitar.”
We can also be bound to a  negative identity.  We may develop identities (inner and outer) in which we are thought of as “lazy”, “a failure” or “a bad kid”.  These can have much more obvious negative impacts on our lives.  Carrying the weight of these negative identities can feel crushing, especially when they are absorbed into your own conscious inner identity.  At this point you have your own negative voice, sitting on your shoulder, whispering in your ear that you are not good enough.  This is extremely hindering to the human potential that exists within each of us.
This is the weight that identity carries, this is how one can become trapped by the idea of themselves.  When we let our identities define who we are, we become a prisoner to it.  We end up missing out on talking with someone interesting because “i am shy”.  We end up susceptible patterns of addiction because “it’s what I do”.  We end up passing up things that we feel deeply drawn too because it doesn’t fit the version of our self which we have always been comfortable being.   Any piece of your identity can become an excuse to not try something new, an excuse to not BE something different.
Because our identity is something that, from the get-go was defined by others, if we do not learn to push the confines of our identity, we will be trapped as a creation of others.  We will never truly experience living life as who we are.  We will never truly experience freedom.
To be consciously-empowered instead of identity driven, is a goal worth life itself.  It is a huge step in the evolution of our personal consciousness.  In order to achieve this we need to look within and understand who we are and what drives us.  We exist between a vanished past and an unknown future, with the only constant being ourself.  We must strive to become a master of this inner domain.
Our inner conscious identity is the control panel to who we are.  It is the best starting place to make changes to who you are, and to achieve being who you want to be.  But, it is heavily influenced by the other aspects of identity and edentity.  Being aware of who we are consciously takes effort and patience.  Understanding the different parts of yourself gives you a map to a muddled terrain.  We must listen to our inner dialog, we must watch the decisions we make, and we must question why we do what we do...consciously.  Through this we gain control of who we are.
Who am I?
It is a simple question with an uncertain answer.  I feel I am still just scratching the surface of who I am.  However these three words amount to an invaluable tool for understanding ourselves.  Through this question we can shift the power from being what the world has made us, to living in a world we create.
