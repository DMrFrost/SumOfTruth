Evolution of Knowledge
SumOne
SumMonth/2015
Evolution not only captures the idea of change over time, but it gives reason to the force behind this change.  Although evolution is generally attributed strictly to biological entities and the populations that they comprise, the same process occurs on a much broader spectrum.  In many aspects of the economy, organizational models, and modern science,  the same branching model is seen as in biological evolution.   This is because the processes which drive that of biological evolution are analogous to (if not identical to)  those that drive progress of scientific theory and technology.

Ideas stem from older ideas, the better idea survives and is further modified by the selective pressures of human technological/self-beneficial application.  The fitness increase to a population due to the application of a new idea, directly reflects the fitness of the idea itself.   As a surviving idea is tracked though time, the pattern of branching occurs, as different individuals modify it in new random ways.  In this way the lineage of an idea may continue forward, branch intomultiple lineages (ie.  NASA material engineering,  is then branched out into civilian products), or dead end all together as an extinction event when obsoletion occurs.
Human knowledge is stored much like genetic material, however much less efficiently.  As where all of the variation of life is stored in a four letter code, all human knowledge is stored within ~52 alphabets, ~28 syllabaries (ie. Cherokee), ~15 ideograms (ie.  Egyptian) summing to an astounding number of individual symbols for storing data.  However, our knowledge and its heritability follow the same primary guidelines as species evolution.  It is prone to change and alteration, based on selective forces, random mutation, gradual drift, and competition.  You can even make an argument for sexual propagation of knowledge through the collaboration of separate ideas in the sense of information recombination.
Knowledge can be fixed or lost like genetic alleles.  It is fairly obvious that knowledge can be lost, the shroud of uncertainty that slowly engulfs the past stands as testament.  The pyramids today show this, unless new records are uncovered there is no way to know the exact methodology used in their construction.   An idea may also be fixed in populations,  when enough evidence supports the idea, it may be transferred and propagate to the point of excepted universal truth.  The world went from flat to spherical in one mans mind, and took root and spread through his population.  Now this is excepted by the vast majority.

The original idea of the world being round came via one persons mental mutation. (this transformation of ideology deserves a paper of its own)  Mutation occurs in the progression of information just as it does in the procession of genetic information.  As stated by Jurgen Habermas ( 1976) “At the basis of cultural tradition there is evidently a variety-generating mechanism, in what is for the time being a vague sense, corresponds to mutation.”  J. Habermas is correct, but to what extent does the similarity persist?  The change in ideology occurs randomly via individuals and is entertained for a varying amount of time.  If the idea seems sound in its logic and application it may even be accepted by others thus establishing itself in a population.  Evidence, usefulness, and added fitness to the population act as “selection” and will determine how long the ideology persists.  Just like most deleterious mutations rarely survives to reproduce in nature, a worsened idea rarely makes it out of primary thinkers mind.   (It must be mentioned that there is a difference here.  Because of multiple alleles, multiploid organisms can maintain deleterious alleles as genetic load.  Therefore much genetic information, detrimental to the host may persist in a population.  A question needing investigation at this point would be, Is there an information load??  Is there an abundance of terrible ideologies, and information out there in certain populations that hinders us all and is dangerous to the host (human) species?  I would argue yes, look at scientology, but as I said this deserves more thought.)
Another example of evolution based on human understanding is raised by Robert Huggins(2000), that of the changing landscape of the modern day business model, “...knowledge cluster development is shifting from one of internal reliance to models based on wider connectivity and consolidations.  It is these new patterns of connected clusters, and broadened knowledge networks that both firms and policy makers are attempting to foster.  A framework outlining the key stages of evolution through which knowledge clusters advance is proposed.” This manages to fit neatly under the title of evolution, since each corporation is recognized as an “individual person”, thus making up a population which is of the taxa corperatis conglomeratis.
The parallels between biological and knowledge based informational evolution are many, they require a more thorough research and many more pages to adequately compare.  Let us quickly do a rundown of some places where this comparison may break down.
&bull;A DNA sequence correlates to the fitness of an individual as where knowledge correlates to the fitness of a population.  (The individual can also be seen as a population of cellular organisms).
&bull;Mutations in the DNA are a result of DNA polymerase mechanical failure as where mental mutations are a result of cognitive work.
&bull;As where random genetic drift occurs in a population there are no obvious examples of an analogous “knowledge drift”.
With further research and thought, I am of the impression that these (along with other) inconsistencies between the two models could be resolved.  After all, at the heart of the issue, genetic  evolution and the scientific method both seem to follow the same mantra, try everything, keep what works.
