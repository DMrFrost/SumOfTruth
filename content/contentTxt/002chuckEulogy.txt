Eulogy for Charles Frost
SumOne
Feb/2016
I’d like to welcome this abundance of friends, colleagues and family, all people that lived and worked with this man. As you all know we are gathered here today, to celebrate a great man, Charles Henry Frost, Chuck to his buddies, or GrandDad to me. To “celebrate”, we chose that word carefully to reflect the sentiments that this is indeed a gathering of joy, to honor and remember the good times, and great things Charles represented.
It is true, grief plays its own roll in the loss of a loved one.  I feel that not only did I lose my Grandad, but I lost a part of myself, a fountain of wisdom that was ever available to me.
Growing up in a cabin in crater-lake to working his way into the upper echelons of the tech industry and politics, his perspective captures more then what most of us get a chance see.  He had much wisdom on life and on the world he lived in, and he shared it willingly,… sometimes even when it wasn’t asked for.

In grief we must ask, “why death?”  Why is this beautiful gift of life marked with its inevitable conclusion?  Why must we face loss and grief over and over again?  It’s a trial… sure.  But it is more importantly what gives life its value. Finality is what makes the experience of being alive truly precious.  The temporary nature (scarcity) of life, is its sanctity.  The conclusion of death is why we must strive to live the best lives we can while we are here.
Grief should be felt, but it should not distract us from the light Charles brought to us, nor from the greatness that each of us can and should strive for in his honor, and in all of our honor.  And because of this we call today, this gathering, a celebration, and a step forward into an ever changing world.  Carrying and honoring what light and wisdom that was passed from one great person… to many.
I was asked to share to share a bit of Chucks highlights and accomplishments, which there were no shortage of. Born, April 4th 1936, to Wifrid and Hazel Frost. Chuck spent his boyhood with his younger brother growing up in the Crater Lake wilderness, where one of his favorite past times was driving with his dad to the garbage pit and enticing bears to come lean on the car for the best view possible. They moved to Medford when Charles turned 6, and moved again to Portland Oregon just before his senior year.  He joined Grant high school for his final year, participating in debate, choir and sports, he became class president.
The charisma with which Charles moved through life took him many places, and connected him with many people, even as a young man.
Chuck went to Willamette University for two years which ended in a disciplinary expulsion from Dean Mark O Hatfield, their paths would cross again.  Chuck was drafted into the US Army where he was stationed in the pentagon.  While in Virginia he met his lifelong best friend and love of his life, Marilyn.  They were quickly married and moved to Portland OR.  Chuck began a 34 year career with TekTronix which included roles such as director of public affairs and vice president of administration.  He was often the public face of the company, which at its peak, was the largest private employer in the state.  He was instrumental in lobbying efforts that brought the silicon forest to Oregon and creating 55 thousand tech jobs for Oregonians.
After retiring Chuck was active in the community.  He was the Board Director of the Oregon Symphony, he joined the board of the Nature Conservancy of Oregon, the board of Tri-Met, Oregon Independent Colleges Association, Alzheimer’s Research Alliance, and Association Oregon Industries to name a few.  He served the Portland City Club, and the Public Affairs Council.  And eventually burying the ol hatchet with the Dean who expelled him, he moved to Washington DC for a two year stint where he served as a senior fellow for Senator Hatfield. … A full life, a rich life…
He lived 79 good years.  He was married to his lovely wife for 56 sweet years… Perhaps his biggest accomplishment was love, and his stewardship towards nature, the world, and the others around him.  He, will always be, a great man and inspiration to me
What is a man when he is gone?
I watched Charles ponder this question in recent years.  I have seen him study multiple bibles, the Torah, the Koran, and many other philosophical books.  In fact the last book opened on his kindle was by Daniel Boorstine, called “The Seekers”. And if I may share, just the opening sentence, I quote,
“Caught between two eternities – The vanished past and the unknown future – We never cease to seek our bearing and our sense of direction.”

And he never did.  He was a seeker in true form, curious until his final days to better understand himself, his future and the world.
What survives a man when he is gone? I cannot speak to what may or may not wait for one over the threshold of death, but I can speak to what remains here in this world.
We do not simply cease to exist, our life, our light is carried onward in the world for time to come.  What we are when we are gone, is all of the parts of ourselves that we pass on to others.  We live as a rock cast into still water, and we survive death as the ripples that dance across the surface for time to come. We continue to inspire others, and we continue to shape the world.
In me, my grandfather carries on.  He carries on as his curiosity to understand, as his sympathy towards others, and as a steward to this beautiful Earth.  He remains here with me in the decisions I make throughout the day.  He remains here with all of us, YOU TOO, carry a unique part of what was… what is… Charles Henry Frost.
So let us carry him to what would be his favorite part of this celebration, the after party.  I’d ask for anyone who can to Please join us for drinks and food… reminisce, story tell, see some old colleagues and meet some new acquaintances, for we are all here, together… thank you.
