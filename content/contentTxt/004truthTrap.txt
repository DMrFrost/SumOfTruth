Curiosity and the Truth Trap
SumOne
Jul/2017
Curiosity is the force of the human spirit.  It is a mechanism for survival through understanding, and it drives the evolution of culture through innovation and technology.  While curiosity drives us to pursue and find truth; ironically, “achieving truth” in turn is often the death of the curious mind.
Truth exists, in and beyond the physical world.  But it only exists in its whole form.  The entire universe, the sum of it all, exactly where, when and how it is… is the truth.  As soon as we deviate from the whole, we lose our ability to comprehend it.  Being as we are tiny subjective humans floating through space and time, we lost our ability to know this Big truth as soon as we became what we are.  The truth exists to us, but it is only obtainable as an idea, an ideal, and an end of the spectrum between ignorance and truth.  We strive for it, but we must accept that it is beyond our grasp.
Take a tree for example, look at a tree.  The truth that we know is that we see a tree, it has leaves, branches a trunk, we can say it has roots, even though we can’t see them we know they are there.  A very useful model.  But the truth of that tree is something incomprehensible, it contains too much data to actually interpret and understand.  Those of us who have studied trees might know more, perhaps it’s species, it’s food or medicinal uses, or how it is best used for building.  Some may even know the chemical process it uses to power the food chain and all life on earth.  But no matter how far you push the envelope, your knowledge of this tree, there is still more to learn.
If you try to track the motion of every leaf as it blows in the wind, the limitations of your own mind become obvious.  The human consciousness can only process 50bits of information a second(16-60 depending on research group).  The texture of the bark, the imperfect angles of the branches, the number of insect bites and color variations on the leaves, all overload the senses, and when truly focused on, leave you with a sense of Awe.  Sure we can break it down, and try to catalog each piece of the tree to form a better idea.  Leaf samples, bark samples,  core samples all shed light on what this tree is, but it doesn’t show us the truth of the tree in its entirety.  Interestingly, in our attempts to break down and understand the large truth, we have actually changed what it was we attempted to understand in the first place.  If you strip and sample each piece, you now are left describing something that doesn’t exist.  The only model to accurately describe the tree, is the tree itself.
This analogy can be applied to anything.  Even a grain of sand, when looked at with limitless resolution becomes an unknowable world.   (if you think of something that doesn’t fit the model let me know) When applied to the all, it is apparent that the entire truth as it stands is not reachable with our limited capacity to experience.  The grand unified theory to tie together all fields of science, or understanding what is referred to as God, Yewah, Allah and Dios,  is unachievable.
Humanity works to understand what we can and we have made great progress.  We make models that reflect parts of the truth, chemists created the atom , botanists refine the model of plants, just as early map-makers charted the physical earth and theologists scribbled their sacred texts.  These all came about when the curious set out into new frontiers, documented and modeled what they found and shared it with the world.  While these models are extremely helpful in understanding the fundamentals, they must not be confused with the truth.

What if I think I know the truth?
First of all, good for you.  You have probably worked hard to build and support your version of the truth.  We all have.  This takes a lifetime of effort.  But, I would ask you to examine your beliefs, especially your most tightly held convictions, and to ask yourself “Why do I believe this?”  “How does this belief serve me and the world?”  “What are the contradicting viewpoints that offend me”.  You may not find an answer, you probably wont change your perspective, but it is still a valuable tool to understand yourself, and may save you from being locked into a dogmatic paradigm.
The problem is that when you have finally found the truth, you stop searching, when the search stops you stop asking questions, and when you stop questioning your understanding stagnates.  Effectively you plateau at whatever level of understanding you latch onto as “truth”.  This is what the old proverb hints at, “How can you fill your cup if it is already full?”  When a partial truth is accepted as the truth, dogma takes root, new evidence is dismissed, and a higher potential is left unknown.

As soon as we accept a truth as absolute, we bind it to ourselves, to our sense of identity, and to the way we understand the world.  When we believe with conviction, any evidence in contrary becomes a threat that can actually damage and kill part of who we are.  This is why many people will be dismissive, and some even hostile, when confronted with a different opinion.  You may have felt it yourself, when you get into a heated argument about something you really passionately believe, your heart beat quickens, your breath becomes shallow and you become more alert.  Your endocrine system triggers the same fight or flight response that you would find were you in danger.  Eye to eye with a predator.   These moments are critical to understanding yourself and what you believe.  It is important to take a step back and examine why you feel threatened.  Usually it has to do with a deeply held belief feeling threatened.  It is easy to stop listening, shut down empathetically and lash out with criticism.  But if you can remain calm, listen, and respond with your own truth and why you think differently, you may both walk away learning something.  Having empathy in these situations allows you to learn from others, and to see a greater perspective, a more whole version of the truth.  Other benefits are that you potentially make a friend in place of an enemy, and nobodies day has to be ruined.  If left unchecked, an absolute belief can be destructive to conscious evolution, it can lead to confusion, divisiveness, hatred, and can tear the trapped individual away from the experience of present reality.
Thinking about the truth in terms of probability is an invaluable tool.  No matter how much evidence has been stacked one way or the other on an issue, we need to remain open to the idea that perhaps we are on the wrong side, and that absolutely our understanding is incomplete.  This makes us much more flexible in changing when new evidence is encountered, and also takes away the threat of being wrong.  Push the probability as far as you want, “I am 99.999^99% sure that when I jump gravity will pull me back down”.  If one day I jump and don’t come back there is no need to think “My life was a lie! Everything I thought is wrong!!”.  No.  I simply shift my percent of belief to some lower probability.  Then I struggle to swim the air back to earth where I can hold onto something and figure out my next move.
It is important to never bind yourself to a truth, as long as you acknowledge you have room to improve, you will improve.  As long as we dream, speak and act for a better world, we will have a better world.  As long as we keep pushing the frontiers of the unknown, innovation and discovery will occur.  Curiosity drives us toward conscious and cultural evolution only when it is uncaged and free to drive us.  So I urge you, unchain yourself for the archaic ideas of truth which bind you, be free to live on the border between chaos and understanding and point your compass towards the best version of yourself you can imagine.
